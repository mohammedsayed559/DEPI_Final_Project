DEPI Graduation Project â€“ Data Analysis and Business Insights
Our DEPI graduation project aimed to transform raw business data into actionable insights to support decision-making. The project began with collecting business requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of the key objectives and challenges faced by the organization.
Once the requirements were established, we moved to exploratory data analysis (EDA), where I played a key role in examining patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset. Each exploration was carefully linked to the related business requirements to ensure that our findings provided real value.
After gaining initial insights, I focused on data cleaning and preparation, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data quality for further analysis. This step was crucial in making the dataset reliable for in-depth analysis and visualization.
With a clean dataset, we extracted meaningful insights that helped address business challenges, optimize operations, and improve decision-making. The project concluded with a comprehensive report detailing our findings and recommendations, demonstrating how data can drive smarter business strategies.
